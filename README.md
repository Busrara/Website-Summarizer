This Python project shows how to fetch text from a website and summarize it using Latent Semantic Analysis with the sumy library. The project consists of two components:

Fetching Website Text: A function get_website_text fetches the raw HTML content from a specified URL.
Summarization: The summarize_text function uses the LSA summarizer from sumy to create a concise summary of the text, limiting the output to a specified number of sentences.

The script fetches text from a Wikipedia page, provides a preview of the original content, and then gives a summarized version. This project is useful for applications where summarizing web content or extracting the most relevant information from large web pages is needed.
